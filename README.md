## Overview

Blue Devil offers a framework for generating custom Linux images. It simplifies the process of creating operating system images tailored to specific needs. By leveraging the OCI standards, we ensure compatibility across different platforms and environments. This repository serves as a base for developers looking to build efficient and reproducible image workflows.

## Features

- **Atomic Builds**: Create images that are built atomically, ensuring that only complete images are available for deployment.
- **Custom Images**: Tailor images to your specific requirements, adding only the necessary components.
- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Adopt immutable principles for your infrastructure, reducing configuration drift and improving reliability.
- **Linux Support**: Built specifically for Linux environments, ensuring compatibility and performance.
- **OCI Compliance**: Follow OCI standards for image creation and management.
